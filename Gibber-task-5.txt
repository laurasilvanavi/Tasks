Task 5

5.1 Create several different synthesizers to play melody and bass parts using:
https://github.com/laurasilvanavi/gibber-notes/blob/master/another-one-bites-the-dust.gibber

5.2 Add drums.
E.g. k = EDrums('x.x.xxo*', 1/8);

5.3 Add effects on synthesizers like:
mono = Mono({attack: 0.01, decay: 0.25});
mono.play(melodyNotes, melodyTimes);
d = Delay()
mono.fx.add(d)

You can remove effects afterwards like:
mono.fx.remove(d)

5.3 Import speaking lib and say something nice as:
module( 'gibber/publications/SpeakLib' )
Speak().say('This workshop is awesome but it would be great to have a coffee break!', 0.6)

5.4 Change notes (randomly or not), add SoundFont instruments, crash and burn everything until you reach what you like.
Or at least you reach some interesting sounds.
