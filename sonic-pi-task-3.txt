Sonic Pi Task 3

3.1. Record your own sample and play it in additional live_loop next to Task 2 loops.
You can simple drag&drop recorded file to a Sonic Pi - path to a file will be added automatically.
Add effects on top of it.
e.g.     sample "/Users/laura/Documents/sonic-pi/records/folk.wav"


3.2 Add live_audio with some effect on top of it and SING!
with_fx :slicer do
  live_audio :singing, amp: 9
end

Tip 1: If yore not using headphones, for this task it is crucial
Tip 2: Use reverb effect - everyone sounds great with this one, believe me and science:

https://github.com/laurasilvanavi/sonic-pi-notes/blob/master/lithuanian-folk-song.sonic-pi
Some inspiration might come from: https://youtu.be/hqWIdaAjdmI?t=1986


3.4 Run static version of Lithuanian Folk song: https://github.com/laurasilvanavi/sonic-pi-notes/blob/master/lithuanian-folk-song-static.sonic-pi. Why iterators are needed here? To update the music without any of your additional modification, you need to run the program and you might go for a coffee - you will hear the difference! But do not forget to stop the program afterwards :)


3.5 Create your own song! Use previous samples, add random notes, recreate your favourite song or your country folk song - does not matter until it is fun for you!  Additional notes: https://github.com/laurasilvanavi/sonic-pi-notes/blob/master/gangstas-paradise.sonic-pi Additional examples: https://sonic-pi.net/tutorial  ***Check documentation and tutorials inside Sonic Pi itself by opening Help tool.
