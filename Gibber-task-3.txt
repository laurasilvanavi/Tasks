Gibber Task 3

3.1 Create Synth, Mono, FM or Pluck synthesizer.
E.g. p = Pluck()
Run the program. Do you hear anything? You should not, because you just initialised a synthesizer.

3.2 Describe notes to play with previously created synthesizer. Run the program. 
E.g. p.note(600)
After note modification rerun the program. 

3.3 Create Sample based synthesizer SoundFont. Provide based sample during initialisation from:
https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber/blob/master/docs/input/audio/soundfont.md. 
Describe notes and run the program.
E.g. c = SoundFont('cello')
     c.note(600)

3.4 Play these melodies by changing frequencies like:
A: 330 -> 330 -> 330 -> 330 -> 330 - > 330 -> 330 -> 390 -> 260 -> 290 -> 330
B: 245 -> 325 -> 385 -> 365 -> 325 -> 385 -> 325 -> 365 -> 325 -> 255 -> 290 -> 245
